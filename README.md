# Gas-smoke-detector-using-Arduino UNO 
The sensor exhibits varying output voltage corresponding to the level of smoke/gas present in the atmosphere. The voltage output is directly proportional to the concentration of smoke/gas detected.
There is a linear relationship between the voltage and concentration. Output voltage increases with higher gas concentration and decreases with lower gas concentration.
