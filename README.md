# Gas-smoke-detector-using-Arduino UNO 
This Gas/ Smoke Sensor is sensitive to smoke and to the following flammmable gases like LPG, Butane, Methane, Hydrogen, Alcohol, Propane. The smoke sensor incorporates a built-in potentiometer for adjusting the threshold of the digital output (D0). This threshold determines the level at which the digital pin will generate a high signal.
The sensor exhibits varying output voltage corresponding to the level of smoke/gas present in the atmosphere. The voltage output is directly proportional to the concentration of smoke/gas detected.
There is a linear relationship between the voltage and concentration. Output voltage increases with higher gas concentration and decreases with lower gas concentration.
The sensor provides two output options: an analog signal (A0) for reading with an Arduino's analog input, or a digital output (D0) for reading with an Arduino's digital input.
